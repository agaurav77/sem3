bitworks
--------
An open source collection of content written for my undergraduate course, starting from Semester 3. 

Why this trouble? Did you not have your college content already in electronic format?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah, you guessed it right. Most of my college uses notes already written by students, i.e. photocopied over generations. Some fragments of the work reside in electronic pdf files, that have been created by teachers(so they don't look appealing). I have been experimenting with LaTeX since the second semester, and finally I have the courage to put my content online. By the way, my college is BIT Mesra.

All I see is LyX files. Where is the content?
---------------------------------------------
The content is in them. Download LyX (LyX is a WYMIWYG editor for LaTeX) and open the files. Then the content is all yours! For convenience, however, I'll give pdf files soon.

Does your college not have issues with you sharing the material online?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Skim over the web, and you'll find notes written by people during their college life, and that too for free. My content just resembles the course names (and those have not been compromised with in any way), so I don't see why anyone else has the right to stop me. I'm just putting my notes into electronic format, that's it, so that people can benefit from it.

If I'm at your college, should I study from these notes only?
-------------------------------------------------------------
No, absolutely not. Every course has some prescribed text books, and those are the things that help throughout. These notes are just an online version of my notes and things I've understood. It is in no way, complete, or intended to replace the actual course material which you get by going to the class. This is just for reference, or maybe revision. I'm just a student yet, and I still have a lot to learn.

Your work has errors.
---------------------
Yeah, that is kinda possible. Thinking and typing, you could go wrong with grammar or spelling mistakes or formulae sometimes. I apologize for all such errors. If you spot such a mistake, please create an issue. I'll have it fixed.

What can I do with your work?
