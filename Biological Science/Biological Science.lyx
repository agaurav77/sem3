Properties and Definition of Life
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Living organisms differ from non living objects in the following particular
 properties:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Living organisms are

\begin_layout Plain Layout
having definite shape, size and structure
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
They have definite organisation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
They always have cellular nature, so they are either unicellular or multicellula
r.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
They show coordination between different parts of what maintains a 
\series bold
homeostasis

a constant temperature range inside the body
\end_layout

\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
They can ability to move and perform locomotion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
They show metabolic functions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
They have the ability of internal growth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
They have the ability to excrete.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
They have specific glands for useful secretions eg.
 mammary glands etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
These have specific receptors to recieve external and internal stimuli eg.
 muscle and glands to give specific response.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
They have regulatory mechanisms eg.
 nervous and hormonal mechanisms (animals) and only hormonal mechanisms
 (plants) to maintain homeostasis inside the body.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
They show adaptations to their environment to increase their chances of
 survival.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
They show variations which help in 
\series bold
speciation
\series default
 and 
\series bold
evolution
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
They have reproductive powers for continuing their race.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
They have a definite lifespan (i.e.
 the period from life till death)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
They undergo aging after adulthood and then die a natural death.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, in the light of these properties of living organisms, life can be defined
 as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\series bold
Life 
\series default
is a unique, complex organisation of molecules, expressing itself through
 chemical reactions which lead to growth, development, responsiveness, adaptatio
n and reproduction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Although I wouldn't say life is completely defined yet.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Division of Life
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Revision of groups includes classification of a group of species, naming
 them and finally understanding their evolutionary relationships.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Species
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Species include a group of individuals which resemble closely in structure
 as well as functions.
 Ordinarily species cannot breed freely with other species.
 (There are exceptions however!) The lowest category of living organisms
 is species.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Genera
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Genus (plural 
\emph on
genera
\emph default
) forms a taxonomical category higher than species.
 It is a group of closely related species eg.
 dogs, jackals and wolves are in the same genus, because they are closely
 related to each other but belong to different species.
 Similarly, potato, brinjal etc.
 are placed in the same genus 
\series bold
solanum
\series default
 but belong to different species 
\series bold
tuberosum
\series default
 and 
\series bold
melongena 
\series default
respectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The common characteristics of species in a genus are called 
\series bold
correlated characteristics
\series default
.
 Sometimes, a genus may be made up of only one species as in humans.
 (of course, if you remember that humans are called 
\emph on
homo sapiens
\emph default
, it's worthwhile to inform you that our genus is 
\emph on
homo
\emph default
)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Family
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A number of genera having several common characteristics form a family eg.
 
\series bold
solanum 
\series default
and 
\series bold
datura
\series default
 have some common characteristics, so they are placed in the family 
\series bold
solanaceae
\series default
.
 The genus 
\series bold
vulpus
\series default
 shows few common characteristics with 
\series bold
canis
\series default
.
 Thus, both of these genera are placed in the same family 
\series bold
canidae
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Order
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A number of families having common characteristics are placed in an order.
 Cats, tigers etc.
 belong to a family 
\series bold
falidae
\series default
.
 Bears are included in 
\series bold
ursidae
\series default
.
 Because cats, tigers, bears are carnivores, their families are included
 in the order 
\series bold
carnivora
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Class
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The class is a basic category.
 Similar orders are placed in the same class.
 
\series bold
Mammalia
\series default
 includes orders like 
\series bold
carnivora
\series default
, 
\series bold
chiroptera
\series default
, 
\series bold
rodentia
\series default
, and 
\series bold
primates
\series default
.
 There are a few characteristics in common eg.
 the presence of mammary glands and hair.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Phylum
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many classes with similar characteristics are included in the same phylum.
 Phylum 
\series bold
chordata
\series default
 includes 
\series bold
pisces
\series default
, 
\series bold
amphibia
\series default
, and 
\series bold
mammalia
\series default
, because all of them have common characteristics such as the presence of
 notochord, dorsal hollow nervous system and pharynx perforated by gill
 slits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Kingdom
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is the highest category of taxonomic study of living organisms.
 All animals are included in the kingdom 
\series bold
animalia
\series default
 and all plants are included in the kingdom 
\series bold
plantae
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
[W] Robert H.
 Whittaker (December 27, 1920â€“October 20, 1980) was an eminent American
 plant ecologist, active in the 1950s to the 1970s.
 He proposed the five-kingdom taxonomic classification of the world's living
 organisms into the Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista, and Monera in 1969.
 He also proposed the hittaker Biome Classification.
